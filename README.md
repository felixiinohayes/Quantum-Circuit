# Quantum Circuit Simulator
This is a C++ project that simulates a quantum circuit, allowing users to build quantum circuits using predefined quantum gates and compute the resultant quantum state. The project handles multiple qubits and common gates, and prints the circuit diagram and quantum state in bra-ket notation.
## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/felixiinohayes/Quantum-Circuit
cd Quantum-Circuit
make
```
